The butterfly effect is a concept from chaos theory that describes how small changes in initial conditions can lead to vastly different outcomes. It is often illustrated with the metaphor that the flap of a butterflyâ€™s wings in Brazil could set off a chain of events leading to a tornado in Texas.

Key Points:
Sensitivity to Initial Conditions: In chaotic systems, even tiny variations in the starting state can result in significantly different outcomes. This makes long-term prediction extremely difficult.
Nonlinearity: The systems exhibiting the butterfly effect are typically nonlinear, meaning that the output is not directly proportional to the input.
Deterministic Chaos: Despite being deterministic (governed by precise laws), these systems appear random and unpredictable due to their sensitivity to initial conditions.
Example:
The Lorenz attractor, which you saw in the animation, is a classic example of the butterfly effect. It was discovered by meteorologist Edward Lorenz while studying weather patterns. He found that small rounding errors in his computer simulations led to drastically different weather predictions, highlighting the inherent unpredictability of weather systems.

The butterfly effect underscores the complexity and interconnectedness of systems, reminding us that small actions can have far-reaching consequences.
